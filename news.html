                <p>As America reopens, it is vital that the workplace remains safe for all its employees. Traditional social distancing methods and 
                    facial coverings do nothing to limit the circulation of viruses in air units, which is why Global Plasema Solutions has developed an air 
                    treatment process that is well suited to killing viruses.

                Offices are traditionally dry, shaded from direct sunlight, and cool.  However, recent research has indicated that these conditions allow COVID-19 to spread.  
                Coronavirus is not airborne like measles and smallpox, but in certain scenarios the virus has been found to survive for hours while in the air. Because of this, 
                it is essential we ensure that the air we are breathing is free from contaminants. Along with traditional sanitation and social distancing measures, air filtration 
                must evolve to meet the new sanitation demands that are now a part our world.

                    The Department of Homeland Security has announced that UV light is a reliable method to stop the spread of this virus. With this in mind, Air-Tec has partnered 
                    with several UV Air-Treatment contractors to install Covid-19 prevention methods in our client’s buildings. Through the use of Ultra-Violet Radiation, regular 
                    air filtration can be modified to destroy up to 99.9999% of all bio-contaminants, including viruses and bacteria.  This non-invasive, non-toxic process can be 
                    incorporated into nearly any HVAC system.  Click the button below to learn more about these products.

                    While it is important to ensure that the air we breathe is contaminant free, these products should never be a substitute for the other 
                    common virus prevention methods. These devices will purify the air, but do not remove contaminants from frequently touched surfaces,
                     such as desks and door handles.  Even with the implementation of these devices, it is still important to wash our hands regularly and 
                     practice social distancing whenever possible.
